Speed testing, hand timed in seconds

--------TEST 1---------
3 mountains in home_mountain_forecast, 'h' command
during testing, computer had approx 25 idle chrome tabs, idle spotify app, one tab streaming youtube video

code:
def home_mountain_forecast():
    thread_list = []
    for i in home_mountain_list:
        thread_list.append(threading.Thread(target=snow_total, args=(i, home_mountain_forecast_days)))
    for i in thread_list:
        i.start()
    for i in thread_list:
        i.join()
    return

--------TEST 2---------
3 mountains in home_mountain_forecast, 'h' command 
during testing, computer had approx 25 idle chrome tabs, idle spotify app, one tab streaming youtube video

code:
def home_mountain_forecast():
    for i in home_mountain_list:
       snow_total(i, home_mountain_forecast_days)
    return

Time to complete:

Notes: When running with visible browser windows, I was surpised to see that the iteration code
opened all three windows without waiting for the first selenium script to end. (basically the same behavior as TEST 1 code)

--------TEST 3---------
Single mountain in home_mountain_list test, 'h' command
during testing, computer had approx 25 idle chrome tabs, idle spotify app, one tab streaming youtube video

code:
def home_mountain_forecast():
    for i in home_mountain_list:
       snow_total(i, home_mountain_forecast_days)
    return
