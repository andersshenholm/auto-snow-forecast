todo:
- additional testing
- make and stick to conventions (temp variable names, specific file roles, single vs double quotes etc.)
- in shell 'forecast' command, find a way to parse mountains with spaces in the name (i.e. being able to run "f winter park 3" rather than "f winterpark 3")
- match mountain input with Mountain.name instead of or in addition to Mountain.denseurl (i.e. "irwincatskiing" would match the name "Irwin Catskiing by Eleven" but not the denseurl "csirwin")
- cut out "usa - " in mountain location if the final project were to be US exclusive
- expand config options (cm vs in, prompt vs command line mode, etc.)
- generate and edit home mountains list from user input
- implement proper waits in scrape_mountains
- remove underscores when creating alnum inputs (currently "love_land" doesn't match "Loveland")
